# Contribution Guide

## General Contribution Flow
- Ask **good questions** if you are confused, stuck, or just have a question
- Try your best to follow the general coding structure of the project to keep things clean and consistent
- Make sure you run prettier `shift+option+f` or read on the files you work on before commiting. More on prettier docs [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install)
- Changes should typically be screen responsive before making a pull request
- Make a pull request into `main` and request a review when your ready/done

## Branching
- Branch off per feature/screen **example: chord-menu**

## Commits 
- Should be coherent and not break code
- Use descriptive but simple messages, reference previous commits for examples
- Commits should typically be atomic/small 
><sup>*"Working with atomic git commits means your commits are of the smallest possible size. Each commit does one, and only one simple thing, that can be summed up in a simple sentence.*</sup>"

><sup>*"The amount of code change doesn't matter. It can be a letter or it can be a hundred thousand lines, but you should be able to describe the change with one simple short sentence.*</sup>"
